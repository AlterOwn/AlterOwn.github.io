Sometimes, life just isn’t as easy as taking the path that is clearly set out before you. Structure and rigidity can be confusing. The lights that lead the way can be blinding. If this sounds like you, then perhaps, like few others, you have an entrepreneurial spirit. 

But how do you know if you really do have the spirit? Unless your name is [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) Junior, you probably aren’t going to just drop everything and form a startup out of your garage on a whim. It will take a huge amount of grit and determination to see it through. 

There are several defining ways you can identify if you have this spirit. Here are: “5 Simple Ways you Can Tell if You Have an Entrepreneurial Spirit”.

### **1. You are Easily Bored by Mundane or Unstimulating Tasks**

Whilst Steve Jobs was the creative force that drove the iPhone to come into existence, he most certainly did not work on the assembly line to put the phone together. In 2017, Tech Insider released a [video](https://youtu.be/EDYT36np2mA) about a young student who got a job at a Shanghai Pegatron Factory, where they assemble iPhones. The student worked for night shifts (7:30PM to7:30AM), 6 days a week. His job was to put one screw in the phone that attached the case to the front speaker, for 12 hours at a time. 

If, when reading this above paragraph, your first thought is: “That job sounds like how hell might actually be”, as opposed to: “Oh, that sounds so easy!” Then, you have the first indicator of an entrepreneurial spirit.

### **2. You Were Always Thinking up Novel Ways to Make a bit of Money whilst Growing Up**

It seems like almost every week in the tabloids, we hear about the new ‘Wolf of the Playground’ - a kid making thousands from selling sweets to his fellow students, such was the story with [Nathan John-Baptiste](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/teenager-tuck-shop-wolf-walthamstow-1150-week-earn-school-nathan-john-baptiste-north-london-a7834996.html). Maybe earning thousands was a little on the ambitious side, but if making a few extra bucks flipping your old CD’s on eBay, or earning your pocket money by mowing some nearby lawns on [Airtasker](https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/how-australias-top-airtasker-made-171000-using-the-service/news-story/f986d3d892a354b55ac67c0c27358b76) sounds like what you did growing up, you have the second indicator of an entrepreneurial spirit.

### **3. You Prefer to Control, Rather than Being Told What to Do**

For some people, being consistently told what to do and how to do it when at work is what they need to get them through the day. Not you though, you can’t stand when your boss breathes down your neck, making sure you are jumping through all the hoops to hit your targets. Don’t worry, you are not alone though. Back in 2017, a disgruntled [Twitter employee](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/meet-the-man-who-deactivated-trumps-twitter-account/) disabled Donald Trump’s Twitter account on his last day at the company. If authority sits as well with you, as it does with that guy, entrepreneurship may be for you (It may also be your only option besides jail).

### **4. The Unknown is Exciting to You**

Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, famously compares founding a high-growth startup to jumping off a cliff and [assembling an airplane](https://www.fastcompany.com/3009831/how-linkedins-reid-hoffman-jumped-off-a-cliff-and-built-an-airplane) on the way down. Entrepreneurship is inherently risky, but that is what excites you about it. If stepping out into the abyss stimulates you, rather than scares you, you have an entrepreneurial spirit.

### **5. You Think and Act in Alternative Ways**

An extraordinary number of the worlds greatest and most influential founders dropped out of university, take Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Larry Ellison, to name but a few. This isn’t to say: To have an entrepreneurial spirit, you must have dropped out of school. It means that doing and thinking unconventionally, is what creates great ideas. Whether you love different music, art, or design compared to the mainstream. Or you use technology in novel ways. Thinking and acting differently to the crowd, is a certain sign that you have an entrepreneurial spirit.
